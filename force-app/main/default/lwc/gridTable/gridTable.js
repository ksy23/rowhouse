/**
 * gridTable — the table core. Renders its own SLDS table, owns its own keyboard
 * model and writes its own ARIA. No lightning-datatable underneath.
 *
 * ONE PUBLIC INPUT (HR-2)
 * Everything arrives in one `config` object. Its setter only stores the
 * reference (HR-17): the parent owns the data and hands over a NEW object when
 * anything changes. Derived views (sorting, windowing, cell models) are computed
 * in getters from that reference and memoised in a non-reactive container.
 *
 *   config = {
 *     columns:     [{ field, label, type, editable, sortable, scale, options,
 *                     width, required, wrap, dependentOn }],
 *     rows:        [{ Id, ...fields }]   plain objects (HR-28)
 *     keyField:    'Id'
 *     drafts:      { [id]: { [field]: value } }      uncommitted edits
 *     errors:      { [id]: { row, fields: { [field]: message } } }
 *     selection:   'multi' | 'single' | undefined
 *     maxSelected: number
 *     selectionKey: any value; a new one clears the row selection
 *     sort:        [{ field, direction }]             initial sort
 *     totalRows:   number | -1                        -1 while still loading
 *     layout:      'auto' | 'table' | 'cards'          default 'auto'
 *     diagnostics: true to record benchmark timings (c/gridTiming)
 *     frozenColumns: how many data columns stay put when scrolling sideways
 *     hasMore:     true when the server has rows not loaded yet
 *     loadingMore: true while the next page is on its way
 *     height:      pixels, from the configuration; empty means fill the window
 *     rowNumbers:  true to number the rows down the left edge, as a list view
 *                  does (the configuration's Hide Row Numbers unchecked)
 *     refNames:    { [recordId]: name } for lookup and owner cells
 *     configName:  the grid configuration, which lookup editors search through
 *     formatRules: conditional formats from the server, in order
 *     formatToday: the day TODAY stands for in them (YYYY-MM-DD), or null
 *                  for the day they were first read
 *     grouping:    [{ field, unit }] the grouping, outermost first
 *     groupSummary: { status: 'loading' | 'ready' | 'unavailable', totals }
 *                    counts and subtotals from the server (c/gridGroups rollUp)
 *     fiscal:      the org's fiscal year, for grouping by fiscal quarter or
 *                  year (c/gridGroups fiscalOf); null for none
 *     children:    [{ name, label, configName }] tabs of related records under
 *                  each row; empty for none, and at the deepest level
 *     childCounts: { [recordId]: { total, byTab } } how many related records
 *                  each row has; a row not in it yet has its count on
 *                  the way. Absent: no counts are asked for.
 *     childCountsFailed: true when the counts could not be fetched
 *     level:       1 for a top-level grid, 2 or 3 for a child table
 *     rowActions:  [{ name, label }] the actions in each row's menu;
 *                  empty for no Actions column
 *     filters:     [{ field, operator, value, valueTo }] the user's column
 *                  filters, one per column; the parent owns them
 *     adminFilters: [{ text }] the admin's filters, shown, never removable
 *     userLayout:  { key, widths, wrap, expanded, groupView } the user's saved layout,
 *                 applied once per key; a new key with nothing in
 *                  it puts the admin's widths and wrapping back (Reset layout)
 *     ariaLabel, saving
 *     savingEdits: the edits are being saved (not a delete or an action):
 *                  Save shows a spinner and "Saving…"
 *     saveProgress: how far a save of many batches has got, for the Save bar
 *   }
 *
 * EVENTS OUT (plain-object details, HR-28)
 *   cellchange      { recordId, field, value }
 *   cellschange     { label, changes: [{ recordId, field, value, originalValue }],
 *                     errors: [{ recordId, field, message }] }   one paste, fill or clear
 *   undo / redo     (no detail)
 *   save / cancel   (the Save bar, floating at the bottom)
 *   sortchange      { sort: [{ field, direction }] }
 *   selectionchange { selectedIds: [] }
 *   loadmore        (no detail) the user is near the end of the loaded rows
 *   groupchange     { grouping: [{ field, unit }] } from a column menu
 *   rowaction       { action, recordId } an action chosen from a row's menu
 *   filterchange    { filters } a column filter applied or removed
 *   layoutchange    { widths, wrap, expanded, groupView } a width the user set,
 *                   Wrap or Clip chosen, a row's related records opened or
 *                   closed, the groups' order or percentages
 *
 * THE FOCUS MODEL (HR-13)
 * Focus is remembered as { rowId, field } — a record and a column — never as a
 * screen position. Rows are re-ordered by sorting and re-created by windowing,
 * and LWC's keyed diff can destroy a focused element when it moves (lwc#4291).
 * After every render that could have moved the focused cell, renderedCallback
 * puts DOM focus back on the cell for the SAME RECORD. That is what stops the
 * next keystroke editing the wrong row.
 *
 * ROW WINDOWING
 * `content-visibility: auto` does nothing on a real
 * <table> (table rows are internal table boxes, which size containment does not
 * apply to), and that where it does work it drops the skipped cells out of the
 * accessibility tree. So large views are windowed in JavaScript: only the rows
 * near the viewport are rendered, between two spacer rows, and every rendered
 * row carries aria-rowindex against aria-rowcount (HR-10).
 *
 * HEIGHT
 * The table scrolls inside its own box, so the header stays put and only the
 * rows in view are drawn; the box needs a height. With no Height on the
 * configuration it fills the window: from the box's top edge to the bottom of
 * the window, less room for the Lightning utility bar and, while there are
 * unsaved changes, the Save bar. Salesforce does not tell a component how much
 * room it has, so this is measured after each render and on window resize.
 *
 * NARROW LAYOUT
 * Below NARROW_WIDTH (the SLDS "small" breakpoint, 30em) the grid renders as a
 * list of record cards instead of a table: a 20-column ARIA grid is unusable on
 * a phone and hard to drive with a touch screen reader, while a list of
 * headings, label/value pairs and buttons is what VoiceOver and TalkBack handle
 * natively. Editing uses the same editors and emits the same events. The width
 * is read from the component's own root (HR-24) through ResizeObserver, with a
 * window-resize fallback where Locker does not provide it (HR-23).
 *
 * TEXT WRAP
 * A text column either clips to one line (the default) or wraps to at most
 * three. `column.wrap` is the admin's default; the column header menu (Wrap
 * text / Clip text, the wording lightning-datatable uses) overrides it for the
 * session. Wrapped cells use SLDS's own slds-line-clamp (three lines) and are
 * all exactly three lines tall, so every row keeps one height and the
 * windowing arithmetic stays exact. Clipping is visual only: the full value is
 * in the DOM for screen readers and in the title for a mouse. Cards always wrap.
 *
 * ALIGNMENT BY TYPE (c/gridFormat alignmentFor)
 * Number, currency and percent values sit against the right edge of their
 * cell, in the table and in cards, and so does the column's header label, so
 * digits line up for comparison. In a right-aligned header the sort arrow goes
 * before the label: SLDS shows that arrow only on hover, and after the label it
 * would push the label sideways every time the pointer crossed the header.
 * Checkboxes are centred in the table, header too, so a narrow column of
 * ticks reads as a column; in cards they stay beside their label.
 * Everything else, dates and picklists included, sits at the left.
 *
 * LOOKUPS, OWNERS AND PICKLIST DEPENDENCIES (c/gridFields)
 * A lookup or owner cell holds a record Id and shows the record's name, from
 * config.refNames, linked to the record; it sorts, copies and pastes by name.
 * A dependent picklist offers only the values its row's controlling value
 * allows, and an edit of the controlling field clears dependent values it
 * makes invalid, in the same undo step. A stored invalid pairing is shown as
 * stored until then (TC-038).
 *
 * CONDITIONAL FORMATTING (c/gridFormatRules)
 * Each rendered row is tested against the configuration's format rules, using
 * the values the cells show (unsaved edits included), and each cell takes the
 * classes of the rules it matches: a fill, a text color, bold. The colors
 * are rh- classes on SLDS palette hooks. A cell with an unsaved edit or an
 * error takes no format, so it shows as unsaved or in error until it is saved
 * (a fill outranked SLDS's unsaved color, found in Lightning Experience);
 * the selected range tints over a fill.
 *
 * SPREADSHEET FEEL (docs/spreadsheet.md)
 * A range is the rectangle between an anchor cell and the focused cell, in
 * view positions: Shift+arrows and Shift+click extend it, any plain move
 * collapses it, and sorting clears it. Copy, paste, fill-down and clear work on
 * the range (or the focused cell) and never write to a record: they emit
 * `cellschange` with every change of one action together, so the parent keeps
 * them as drafts and can undo them as one step. Clipboard listeners sit on this
 * component's own root element, the one place Lightning Web Security delivers
 * clipboard events to. Frozen columns are sticky cells with a
 * left offset taken from the pinned column widths.
 *
 * GROUPING AND SUBTOTALS (c/gridGroups)
 * A grouped grid is a treegrid. A Group column, after the utility columns,
 * holds each group's toggle, name and record count; the group's header row
 * holds its subtotals under their columns, and its rows follow, one level
 * deeper. Header rows are rows of the view like any other, with synthetic
 * ids, so focus, windowing and the keyboard treat them alike; editing, paste,
 * fill, clear, copy and row selection skip them. Enter or Space on a group's
 * Group cell opens or closes it. Each column menu offers grouping by that
 * column, and the Group column's menu expands or collapses every group,
 * changes a date's unit, or removes the grouping; the parent owns the
 * grouping (groupchange) because a new one needs the server. Counts and
 * subtotals cover every matching record, from the server; the Total row, in
 * a table of its own under the grid, shows the whole list's.
 *
 * MORE GROUPING
 * The Group column's menu also orders the groups by name, record count or a
 * subtotal, largest or smallest first, and shows each group's share of the
 * whole list's count and sums; both are kept with the user's layout. A date
 * groups by week and by fiscal quarter and year too. Subtotals follow unsaved
 * edits (c/gridGroups withDrafts), marked as unsaved until they are saved. A
 * groupable header dragged onto the Group header, or onto the drop zone that
 * shows above the table while it is dragged, groups by it (mouse only; the
 * column menu does the same from the keyboard).
 *
 * CHILD TABLES (c/gridNest, c/gridChildren)
 * With tabs in config.children, a column after the selection column holds a
 * toggle on each record. An open record is followed by a detail row: one cell
 * across the table, holding c/gridChildren, a tab per child table, each a grid
 * of its own. Detail rows are rows of the view with synthetic ids, like group
 * rows, so windowing, focus and the keyboard treat them alike, and editing,
 * paste, fill, clear, copy and selection skip them. A detail row is
 * a fixed height by level (gridNest detailHeight), so a row's top is still
 * arithmetic (gridNest rowTop).
 * Enter on the detail cell moves focus into the open tab's grid; Escape there,
 * when the child grid has no use for it, brings focus back. Keys, clicks,
 * focus and clipboard events from inside a child grid bubble up through this
 * table's root; they belong to the child, so this table ignores them
 * (fromChild). Open rows last for the session.
 *
 * AFTER THE UX REVIEW
 * - Frozen cells take the row's hover and selected colors (rh-row_selected).
 * - The name field links to its record; email and phone are mailto: and tel:.
 * - Every sortable column has a menu with Sort ascending and descending; a
 *   read-only column's cells show their lock only on hover or focus, like the
 *   pencil. Its header has no lock, as in a list view.
 * - Columns are never narrower than their type needs (c/gridSizing); number
 *   and date columns widen to fit their widest loaded value; the table
 *   scrolls sideways instead of squeezing. A wrapped row takes the lines its
 *   values need, one to three.
 * - Typing on an editable cell, F2, Enter (on a cell that is not a link) and a
 *   double-click start editing.
 * - Panels are sized to their content; the toggle shows how many related
 *   records a row has and is hidden when it has none, or while its count is
 *   on the way (offersToggle).
 * - Group rows show their count as "(n)", levels are shaded apart, the
 *   grouping shows as chips above the table, and a count of nothing is blank.
 * - A row format's fill is a bar at the row's left edge; formats carry labels.
 * - An empty list says so. Undo and Redo sit in the Save bar.
 * - Cards show the title and three fields; the rest on request.
 *
 * ROW ACTIONS
 * With config.rowActions, the last column holds a menu button on each record
 * row, as a list view's row-level actions do; a group's row has none. Its
 * menu is drawn only for the row it is open on, one row at a time (rowMenu),
 * with the header menus' keyboard model: Enter, Space or Alt+Down on the cell
 * opens it on the first item, arrows move, Enter chooses, Escape closes. It
 * opens upwards only where it fits between the row and the header; otherwise
 * downwards, and a short grid grows to hold it (measureMenuRoom). The table only
 * says which action on which record (rowaction); the parent runs it. In cards,
 * each card has the same menu (lightning-button-menu).
 *
 * FILTERS, LAYOUT, EDITORS AND FORMULAS
 * - A column the server marks filterable has Filter… in its menu, which opens
 *   c/gridFilterPanel under the header; a filtered column shows a filter icon
 *   beside its label, and the filters are chips above the table with the
 *   grouping's, the admin's among them, locked. The parent owns the filters
 *   (filterchange), because a new one needs the server.
 * - The user's widths, Wrap or Clip and open rows are told to the parent
 *   (layoutchange), which keeps them in Salesforce; a saved layout comes back
 *   in config.userLayout and is applied once.
 * - Date/time, time and text area cells have editors (c/cellDateTime,
 *   c/cellTime, c/cellTextarea). A value the server shortened (row._cut, TC-055)
 *   is edited in the text area editor, which reads the whole text first, and
 *   is never the source of a fill down.
 * - A cell a rule gives an icon shows it before the value; a data bar is a
 *   bar behind the number, scaled to the column's loaded values.
